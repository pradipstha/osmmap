# osmmap

This is a simple script that creates beautiful maps of any city's streets and bike paths. Think of it like having your own personal map-making assistant that can draw professional-looking city maps with just a few lines of code.
* Type in any city name (like "Paris, France" or "Tokyo, Japan") and automatically create a map
* Get a stylish black-and-white map showing all the streets and bike lanes
* Save the map as an image you can print, share, or use in presentations

No manual drawing required - let the script pull the data and sketch it for you!
